INTERPOLATED VELOCITY MODELS

This directory is where interpolated velocity models will be saved when you use
the "Save Data as TXT" or "Save Data as BIN" functions in the velrecover application.

The saved files will be named based on the input SEGY file name, with
"_interpolated_2D.dat" or "_interpolated_2D.bin" appended depending on the format.
