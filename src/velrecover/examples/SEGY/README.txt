SAMPLE SEGY FILES

This directory should contain SEGY seismic data files.
Due to file size limitations, no actual SEGY files are included in the distributed package.

You can place your own SEGY files in this directory.
Sample velocity data files in VELS/RAW/ are provided for demonstration purposes.

For real usage:
1. Copy your SEGY files to this directory
2. Create corresponding velocity data files in VELS/RAW/ 
   (format: CDP, TWT, VEL tab-separated columns)
3. Use the velrecover application to interpolate and visualize the data
